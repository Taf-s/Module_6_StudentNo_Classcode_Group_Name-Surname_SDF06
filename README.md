# SDF06 Project

This is the readme file for the shopping cart app 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create a shopping cart mobile app following the instructions in the Scrimba course. The shopping cart had to be fully functional so we had to create our own database using Firebase in order to store the data. Furthermore, using javascript to make the app functional so that it can fetch the data from the databs, add and eliminate items when needed.

## Design Choices and Functionality 

For the project i did basic styling for the app, the image, input field, add to cart button and the list items that appeare at the bottom. 
For functionality I used javascript in order to fetch and store the data from Firebase, add items to a list at the bottom when they are put in the input field and to remove items from the list when you click on them. 

## Features 

Overall I was quite pleased with the functionality of the app in particular. 

* The ability to fetch, store, and add data from Firebase 
* The simple design language that makes it easier for the use experience 

## Technologies Used 

*CSS for styling the buttons, Firebase for database, and Javascript for functionality.
